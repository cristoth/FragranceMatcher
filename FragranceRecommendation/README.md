# Fragrance Recommendation
This project was created using Python 3.7 and Gensim (NLP - word2vec) to train an AI model to find compatibilities
in the fragrances of the perfumes.
<br />
## Structure
csv_to_json.py and unique_fragrances.py are used for data preprocessing. Run word2vec.py in order to see the data
statistics and some examples of how the model is working.
